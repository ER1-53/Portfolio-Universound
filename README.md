## Nginx vs Apache

Both are web servers. They use HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and can be used as proxy servers.

Nginx handles more simultaneous connections

Apache is more traditional and may be better suited to simpler configurations.

## JavaScripte(JS) vs Python

Two programming languages, used on both client and server sides, and for their OOP.

JavaScript is used for web development, with an asynchronous architecture.

Python is used in many fields, including web development, and has options for asynchronism.

## MySQL vs PostgreSQL vs MongoDB

These are SQL-based database management systems (DBMS).

MySQL and PostgreSQL are relational databases.

MySQL is recognized for its performance under heavy workloads and benefits from a large community. It is easy to configure.

PosgreSQL is strictly ACID* compliant. It offers extensive support and complex SQL functionality. It is flexible and handles complex tasks.

MongoDB is based on a NoSQL model. It is highly flexible and stores data as JSON documents. This flexibility makes it highly efficient for managing large quantities of data.

*The four ACID principles are atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. 

## React vs Angular vs Vue.js

Popular frameworks/libraries for web-based user interface development.

React is easy to use and can be integrated with other libraries such as Redux for global state management.

Angular is a more difficult framework to learn, but a very complete one with its own ecosystem.

Vue.js is somewhere between a library and a framework, easy to learn for beginners and easy to integrate into existing projects.

## Node.js/Express.js vs Ruby on Rails

Web frameworks for server-side development.

Node.js is used with JavaScript, offering greater flexibility but requiring more configuration.

Ruby on Rails uses Ruby, is fast to develop and integrates an ORM. It has a strong community.



# Challenge

- Firstly, we want to create a website with personalized account creation and use.
    
    We want finish this step for the first year of formation with many music to streaming.
    
- Secondly, we want to stream copyright-free music and group chat or group favorite sound. (optional)
- Finally, we want to create four algorithms to optimize the user's relationship with the music. (optional)

The site won't be able to meet the same requirements as a commercial site of the same type. The project is divided into several stages so that it can evolve and be continued after its presentation.

Today, the algorithm for music is oriented towards musical style (rap, R&B, rock...) or listening preference.

I propose to create a new algorithm with a new vision of the user's needs.

- the lexical field
- the rhythm

For example:

When I listen “sans repère” of Sniper, I want:

- lexical field proposition “Mon vieux” of Daniel Guichard
- rhythm like “ ( the better is one algorythm for define)”
    
    The user will be all user of application or website of music streaming.
    

It isn’t dependent on a specific locale.



# Infrastructure

- Using VSCode, we'll create a `TEST` test branch and an `In progress` work branch. The former will be used during the back-end testing phase, while the latter will be used throughout the project, and at each stage of creation will be merged with the main branch, then recreated to continue the project's progress, task by task.

- Our UniverSound site will be deployed in real time on our web server, but will not be accessible until it goes online.

- Process evolution will be monitored by assigning a color code to each process.
    
    For development :
    
    - Gael and Erwan will have their own branch, which will be checked by both before being merged with the main branch.
        
        Red task to do, blue task in progress and green task finalized.
        
    
    For the test phase:
    
    - A <folder_name>/tests/tests_units zone will be created, using Jest.
        
        blue task in progress, green task tested and validated.
        
    
    For the real-life situation:
    
    - Deployment will take place on a test area on a local server, then on the cloud in ssh via VScode and git or manually via filezilla.
        
        Blue task being tested, green task validated
        

- The various data will first be processed locally, then transmitted via SSH to our server. The test can be carried out by calling the site via https to the currently undefined domain name.

The data will be processed in different ways:

the web application will be stored on the server and usable via an https gateway.

user data, account information, preferences will be stored in the database

music data :

either stored locally, in case the content needs to be preserved

or stored on the database to preserve playlists

or streamed with cash memory

For the moment, no automation system is planned, but the use of a local backup application FBackup or Ashampoo Backup Pro 16 will be considered.

Filezilla may be used in the event of propagation difficulties.

The various tests will be carried out using Jest, a tool developed for testing JavaScript applications.

# Existing Solutions

There are many online music streaming solutions, but we want to set ourselves apart with the final stage of the project: the instruction of two original algorithms, dealing with lexical fields and rhythmic variations.

The site itself will be original, and the system for creating and using accounts will be inspired by that of Spotify.

For the algorithmic phase, we'll be exploiting a number of different avenues, such as the algorithm used by Shazam for rhythmic recognition, the creation of music lyrics from Amazon music, or the retrieval of online lyrics and their exploitation.



# Architecture

![Architecture FLux Universound.jpg](readme/Architecture_FLux_Universound.jpg)

When a User Accesses the UniverSound site ([universound.ddns.net](http://universound.ddns.net/)) and wishes to listen to music; the site returns this either by caching, or with a local download for offline listening. All the information on the site is hosted by "Hostinger" (which avoids having to manage all the firewall, application server and server redundancy aspects). The Databases are created with "PostgreSQL". The Frontend will be created under "REACT" with the "Redux" container. The Backend will be managed via Node JS and Express JS. We use "Sequelize" (ORM) to make the link between the Databases and the site as such. Finally, the Administration/Monitoring part of the site will be done with "Prometheus" and the graphic interface "Grafana".

# Data Model

We wish to use the PostgreSQL database initially to manage all of our data. We want to have a scalable database depending on the progress of the project. First of all, the management of user accounts and the ability to broadcast music. Then, enhance the system with a possibility of offline listening. Finally, implement all the algorithms for correlating the different music by genre, their lyrics, their rhythm…

## Step 1:

For the first step, we create four databases: "customer", "music" and "legal_notice".

![database Step 1.png](readme/database_Step_1.png)

## Step 2:

In step 2, social_interaction.

![database Step 2.png](readme/database_Step_2.png)

## Step 3:

Finally, the third step involves implementing the necessary algorithms so that the music is related to each other, in order to offer a listening offer adapted to the user.
