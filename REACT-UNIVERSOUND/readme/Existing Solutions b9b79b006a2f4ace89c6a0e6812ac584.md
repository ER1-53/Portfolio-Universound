# Existing Solutions

There are many online music streaming solutions, but we want to set ourselves apart with the final stage of the project: the instruction of two original algorithms, dealing with lexical fields and rhythmic variations.

The site itself will be original, and the system for creating and using accounts will be inspired by that of Spotify.

For the algorithmic phase, we'll be exploiting a number of different avenues, such as the algorithm used by Shazam for rhythmic recognition, the creation of music lyrics from Amazon music, or the retrieval of online lyrics and their exploitation.
