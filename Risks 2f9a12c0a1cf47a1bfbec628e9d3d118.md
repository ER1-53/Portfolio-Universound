# Risks

- Learning / time

One of the main risks is the learning curve and the time it takes to learn. To reduce this learning curve, we've chosen to stick to a suite of tools linked to a single language, JavaScript.

- Alternative

If the learning curve is too steep, we'll use our existing knowledge of the Python language and its various libraries and structures.

- Storage

Losing the project is an important risk to avoid. We could be faced with backup problems, data deletion and, in the worst case, computer failure.

- Solutions

The plan is to work on VSCode and keep our project on a Github repo. In addition, we'll install an online server via an operator (Hostinger or OVH), and keep a local backup on our computers.

The online server will be maintained as the project progresses.

- Security

Injecting attacks can compromise security by exploiting vulnerabilities in user inputs. The use of outdated or insecure libraries may lead to vulnerabilities.

- Solutions

Keep various tools up to date.

- Performance

Excessive loading times can impact user experience and SEO rankings. A sudden increase in traffic can lead to performance issues and downtime.

- Solutions

Choose a server and storage configuration to handle expected traffic.

- Compatibility

Differences in rendering between browsers can cause display problems. The design must be adapted to different types of devices (desktops, tablets, mobiles)

- Solutions

Adapt the site to different web platforms and devices.

- Scalability

A website must be able to adapt to an increase in the number of users. The architecture should allow scalability without requiring a major overhaul.

- Solutions

Create scalable, easily maintainable, documented, and commented code.
