# Challenge

- Firstly, we want to create a website with personalized account creation and use.
    
    We want finish this step for the first year of formation with many music to streaming.
    
- Secondly, we want to stream copyright-free music and group chat or group favorite sound. (optional)
- Finally, we want to create four algorithms to optimize the user's relationship with the music. (optional)

The site won't be able to meet the same requirements as a commercial site of the same type. The project is divided into several stages so that it can evolve and be continued after its presentation.

Today, the algorithm for music is oriented towards musical style (rap, R&B, rock...) or listening preference.

I propose to create a new algorithm with a new vision of the user's needs.

- the lexical field
- the rhythm

For example:

When I listen “sans repère” of Sniper, I want:

- lexical field proposition “Mon vieux” of Daniel Guichard
- rhythm like “ ( the better is one algorythm for define)”
    
    The user will be all user of application or website of music streaming.
    

It isn’t dependent on a specific locale.
